## Simplifying Dockerfile Validation and Generation

**GenVal** is a powerful utility written in Golang that simplifies the process of Dockerfile validation and generation. Whether you're new to Docker or a seasoned pro, GenVal can help you create Dockerfiles that adhere to best practices for security and optimization.

## Why GenVal?

Managing Dockerfiles can be complex. It's crucial to ensure they follow best practices, but this can be time-consuming and error-prone. GenVal takes care of the heavy lifting by automating these processes, making Dockerfile management more efficient.

## Features

- **Input Validation**: GenVal begins by validating your input, which can be provided in JSON format. This initial step ensures that your input data is correctly structured.

- **Dockerfile Generation**: Once your input passes validation, GenVal generates a Dockerfile for you based on the provided data. This Dockerfile will be tailored to your specifications.

- **Best Practice Validation**: After generating the Dockerfile, GenVal doesn't stop there. It checks your Dockerfile against a set of predefined best practices for security and optimization. 

- **Informative Feedback**: If GenVal detects any issues or discrepancies during the best practice validation, it provides informative feedback. This feedback helps you understand what needs improvement in your Dockerfile.

## Getting Started

Using GenVal is straightforward:

1. **Installation**: To install GenVal on your system. You can downlod the executable binary make its executible and you are ready to go.

2. **Validation and Generation**: Run GenVal, providing the path to your input JSON or YAML file and the desired path for the generated Dockerfile. GenVal will take care of the rest.

3. **Review Feedback**: GenVal will display feedback based on the best practice validation. If any issues are found, you can use this feedback to refine your Dockerfile.

## Example Usage

Here's a simple command to use GenVal:

```shell
genval <path/to/input-json> <path/to/Dockerfile>
```

Replace `<path/to/input-json>` with the path to your input JSON file and `<path/to/Dockerfile>` with the desired path for the generated Dockerfile.
