# GenVal

**GenVal** is a Golang-based utility designed to produce a Dockerfile using user-provided input from a `yaml`/`json` file. This tool promotes adherence to Dockerfile best practices related to security and optimization. After generating the Dockerfile, **GenVal** proceeds to assess its compliance with these best practices using the `OPA/Rego` framework. Upon successful validation, the tool provides informative feedback about the validation process.

# TODO

- Validate user input using `OPA/Rego`
